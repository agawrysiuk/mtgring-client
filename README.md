My attempt to create the online Magic The Gathering game.

If you'd like to know more about it, I invite to you to watch the YouTube presentation:

Additional information: all trademarks, MTG Arena software and images are the property of Wizards of the Coast LLC or its parent Company, Hasbro, Inc. Thus, I left out the server version of this application and will not add it, as I don't want to distribute it.

It's only an example of my 2-month work. I hope you enjoyed the video linked above :)
